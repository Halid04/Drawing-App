# My Journey to Becoming a Web Developer Project 6 -Drawing-App
This code creates a drawing app. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a user interface that allows the user to draw on a canvas.

The CSS defines the appearance of the page, including layouts, sizes, colors, and animations. For example, the container that houses the app is set to occupy the entire window and align its elements in the center. The left side contains controls for color and brush width selection, while the right side contains the canvas on which the user draws.

The JavaScript code is responsible for the logic behind the app. When the user selects a color and width, this information is used to draw on the canvas when the user clicks and drags the mouse. The "Clear" button clears the canvas.
